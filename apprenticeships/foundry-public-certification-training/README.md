# About These Study Guides 

Palantir certification training is currently closed to the public. I have been given access to the training materials
and created these study guides using public information that covers the same topics to help prepare you for certification
training. 

**IMPORTANT**: You will need additional training and a Foundry stack to prepare you for certification!

**IMPORTANT**: These guides should not be used as a prerequisite to taking your exam! They are designed to get you
ahead of the learning curve if and when certification is open to the public. 
There is no warranty implied or otherwise made as to the quality of the guide relative to your exam performance!

**IMPORTANT**: These guides are subject to change without notice! Check back regularly for updates or subscribe to this repo.
