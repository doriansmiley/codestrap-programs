## Final Exam
Once you have developed skills you will need a way to gain
experience. There are three good ways to gain the experience to get you hired.

1. [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). This is a website that helps software engineers find answers to bugs and common problems.
   If you build up a high rank on stack overflow it will help get your foot in the door.
1. [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/auth/signup). Hacker Rank lets developers solve challenges to earn points. Recruiters can then request interviews with top-ranked coders. This is an awesome resource!
1. Contribute to at least one popular open source project for six months. Some popular projects are below:

- [TensorFlow Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)
- [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)
- [Flask](hhttps://github.com/pallets/flask)
- [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip)
- [Palantir Spark](https://github.com/palantir/spark)
