# Software Apprenticeship Programs

## About
Software Apprenticeship Programs are an exciting new track for talented people who do not want to enter the university
system to obtain a valuable job skill. Major tech companies now offer paid apprenticeship programs that
let you earn while you learn. This path is not for the faint of heart. You will need to be a motivated self starter that does not fold under pressure, and possess an aptitude for math.
