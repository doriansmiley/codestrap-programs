I created this open source project to help the community provide an alternative path
to becoming a software engineer through apprenticeship.

Please note [my curriculum](./apprenticeships/curriculum.md) hasn't been officially adopted
by any of the listed programs. Most programs do have a self-taught track though. The courses
I've chosen should fulfil those requirements and then some. If you're interested in helping
me get the curriculum certified, or you would like to adopt it, open an issue.
